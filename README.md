# ðŸ›³ Titanic Dataset Analysis

This repository contains my **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Machine Learning practice** using the famous **Titanic dataset**.  
The dataset is widely used in the Data Science community as a beginner-friendly project for practicing **data cleaning, visualization, feature engineering, and predictive modeling**.

## ðŸ“Œ Dataset Description

The Titanic dataset contains passenger details from the RMS Titanic tragedy (1912).  
It is often used to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on features like gender, age, class, and more.  

### Columns (Features)
- **PassengerId** â†’ Unique ID for each passenger  
- **Survived** â†’ Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)  
- **Pclass** â†’ Ticket class (1 = Upper, 2 = Middle, 3 = Lower)  
- **Name** â†’ Passengerâ€™s name (with title: Mr, Mrs, Miss, etc.)  
- **Sex** â†’ Gender (male/female)  
- **Age** â†’ Passengerâ€™s age (may contain missing values)  
- **SibSp** â†’ Number of siblings/spouses aboard  
- **Parch** â†’ Number of parents/children aboard  
- **Ticket** â†’ Ticket number  
- **Fare** â†’ Ticket fare  
- **Cabin** â†’ Cabin number (many missing values)  
- **Embarked** â†’ Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals of This Project
- Perform **data cleaning** (handling missing values)  
- Explore and visualize survival patterns using **EDA**  
- Apply **feature engineering** (extracting titles, family size, deck info)  
- Encode categorical variables for ML models  
- Build and test simple predictive models  

---

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights
- **Women and children** had higher survival rates.  
- **First-class passengers** were more likely to survive than third class.  
- Most passengers embarked from **Southampton (S)**.  

---

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used
- **Python**  
- **NumPy**  
- **Pandas**  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**  
- **Scikit-learn** (for basic ML models)
